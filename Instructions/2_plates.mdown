# Assembling the Motor Mount Plates
***
![view of motor mount plates laid out]()

### Let's keep a few things in mind:
	1. Smart people, who value their eyesight, always wear safetly glasses.
	2. If you are unsure of what you're doing. Stop doing it. Ask on the forum before ruining your setup.
	3. Have fun. It is, after all, what it's all about. 


### So start things off, let's go ahead and assemble *all* of the v-wheel kits and smooth idlers
	#### V-Wheels (20 wheels total)
		1. Take one ball bearing, and insert it into the delrin v-wheel
		2. Using one of the M5 x 20mm SHCS, slide the wheel over the screw
		3. Slide a single precision washer around the screw
		4. Slide another bearing around the screw
		5. Using your thumbs, squeeze the assembly together. There will be a bit of friction getting the bearings settled into the wheel. When you tighten the wheel to the plate, you will squeeze the entire thing together tightly.
		6. Repeat this proceedure for the remaining v-wheels (20 total)
	#### Smooth Idlers (6 idlers total)
		1. Take one ball bearing, and insert it into the open end of the smooth idler
		2. using one of the m5 x 30mm SHCS, slide the idler over the screw
		3. Slide a single precision washer around the screw
		4. Slide another bearing around the screw
		5. Using your thumbs, squeeze the assembly together. A small portion of the second bearing will be protruding from the edge of the smooth idler. This is normal. We will tighten the entire assembly when the idlers gets bolted to the motor mount plate
		6. Repeat this proceedure for the remaining smooth idlers (6 total)

### There are 2 different styles of plates that we will be building

	1. With Stepper Motor (there are 3 of these)
	2. Without Stepepr Motor (there is 1 of these)

### With Stepper Motor
	These are the plates that will mount on either end of the gantry and on the rear of the X-Axis.
		1. Connect v-wheels to plate
			two static
			two eccentric
		2. Connect the smooth idlers to plate
			two total
		3. Attach your stepper motor
			Using 4 x M3x6mm SHCS, attach the stepper motor
			Use an M3 washer between the SHCS and the plate
			Slide the motor towards the top (end with the double slot) of the plate

### Without Stepper Motor
	This is the plate the z-axis will attach to. It sits on the front of the gantry and will be connected to the x-axis motor mount plate via rigid aluminum spacers. We will build the plate first, and then attach the two together.
		1. Connect v-wheels to plate
			two static
			two eccentric
		2. Connect the Z-Axis Assembly
			Using insertion nuts and M5 x 8mm SHCS
			Squaring?
