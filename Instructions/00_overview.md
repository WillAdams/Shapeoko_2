#Assembly Overview

The ShapeOko is an assembly of sub-assemblies. There are only a few steps:

1. Assemble and test the electronics
2. Assemble 20 V-Wheels (25203-02) and 6 Smooth Idlers (25197-02)
3. Assemble 3 Motor Mount Carriages (PS20022)
4. Assemble Z Assembly Carriage (PS20021), Z-Axis Rail Assembly (PS20028) to make the Spindle Carriage Assembly (PS20029)
5. Assemble Gantry Carriage (PS20031) Sub Gantry (PS20023) to make the Complete Gantry (PS20025)
6. Assemble Waste Board Assembly and Y-Axis Rail Assemblies (PS20024) Slide onto Gantry
7. Assemble the work area to complete the machine

##Some Notes

###Screw Sizes

For the most part, it's obvious which size screw is used for what, but the M5 10mm and 12mm BHCS (button head cap screws) are easily confused â€” while it's not noticeable when the shorter 10mm length is used where one ought to use a 12mm, the 10mm screws are intended for use with MakerSlide insertion nuts and a 12mm screw is too long and will bottom out before beginning to hold anything in place.

###Electronics and Mechanicals

Please note that while the assembly instructions have these two separated, it is probably best to partially disassemble the electronics after testing them and mount the motors onto the appropriate motor mount carriage plates as you are assembling the machine for the Z- and X-axes. Putting this off will require either partial disassembly (Z-axis) or an almost impossible reach into a very cramped space to attach very small screws and washers (Y-axis).

###A Note on Tapping

There is one fabrication-like step which may be necessary, tapping the MakerSlide. If your MakerSlide is not already tapped, and you do not have experience tapping it, it is suggested that you begin as soon as practicable. Do not however, attempt to tap all of the threads in a single session, instead, tap one or two threads, then proceed to the next step in the process. After completing on eor two steps, return to tapping. Doing it in this fashion will avoid the tedium of a lengthy session.

Start w/ the short length which is used for the Z-axis Carriage (it only needs to be tapped at one end, so a failure to tap two good threads at one end will not render it unusable. Tap one thread at either end, then tap one thread in each of the remaining pieces of MakerSlide, then return to the first piece and start over, tapping a single thread in each piece each time.
