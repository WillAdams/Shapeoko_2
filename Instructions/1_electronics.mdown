# Testing your Electronics

### Let's keep a few things in mind:
	1. If you unplug a stepper motor from the controller while it's energized (plugged in), you may very well blow up your controller. 
	2. Being shocked by electricity is no fun.
	3. Being burned by electricity is no fun either.
	4. Smart people, who value their eyesight, always wear safetly glasses.
	5. If you are unsure of what you're doing. Stop doing it. Ask on the forum before ruining your setup.
	6. Have fun. It is, after all, what it's all about. 


You will need the following components to complete this step:

	8. 
	9. 
	10.

You will need the following tools to complete this step in the assembly

### Overview
Beforfe we get all crazy bolting our parts together, we will give our electronics a test run. It's frustrating to have the machine fully assembled, only to find there is a problem with your electronics that may require dis-assembly! Let' cut that off at the pass and give everythign a thorough checking first.

You will need the following components to complete this step:

1. Arduino
2. grblShield
3. Stepper motors (4)
4. Power Supply with wall plug
5. Barrell Connector
6. Small screwdriver
7. Patience (just a little bit)

Now that we have everythign gathered up, you should find yourself with a setup similar to this:

If that's true, great! If it's not true, then either make your setup look like the one shown in the picture, or be prepared not to complain when you can't find something. Because it'll be your own fault.

OK, here we go. Let's get talking to the arduino.

1. First thing that we do is plug our arduino into the computer. Remember, the big end of hte cable goes into the arduino. The flat end of the cable goes into your USB port. There are lots of things that could go wrong here (like your computer not recognizing the board, you attempting to plug the cord in upside down, or some other very boring, silly thing). Chances are the arduino will be recognized by your computer and we can move on to step 2. 

		[If there was a boring, silly problem. Please see these pages to get it resolved:] [windows] [mac] [linux]

2. Open Universal gcode sender.

		[how do I open UGS?]

			For windows: Find the folder that you unzipped the file to. And then find startugcs.bat and double click it.
			For mac: goto your download folder and click UGS
			For Linux: find the folder that you curled the tar far into, and decend into the extracted folder. Then run sudo ./startugs.sh.
			(keep in mind you may need to 'sudo chmod +x startugs.sh' before attempting to execture the script)




3. Once UGS is open, click the refresh button (two arrows chasing each other in a circle) located towards the top left of the window. This will refresh your choices of serial ports.

		[what happens if I get a "no serial ports found" error box?]

Now go ahead an select your serial port and click 'connect'.

		[what to do if you can't figure out what serial port your arduino is using]

4. If all goes well (went well) you should hear a very satisfying click/whooooosh noise. That means that your arduino is connected to your computer and power is being applied to your steppers! Wooohooo! Oh wait, your steppers aren't hooked up yet, are they? OK. We need to go back a few steps and get that straightened out. 

5. close the connection in UGS, shut down the window, and unplug the big end of the usb cable from your arduino.

### It's time to hookup some stuff. 

We have established that your arduino connects to your computer and that you can issue it commands. We have also established that if your motors are not connected to the arduino, then issuing commands doesn't really do anythign at all. So let's go ahead and get everythign hooked up. 

Place the grblShield on your arduino. If you can't figure it out, take a look at this picture for reference:
	![insert picture of gshield being placed onto arduino](picture.jpg)

No connect your stepper motors. Connecting the motors are easy, just do this
	![black green red blue]()

If you're looking at yiour controller wondering why there are only 3 temrinals and 4 steppers motors. We'll get to that later. Long story short, we are sharing one of them with your dual Y motors.

Let's hookup the power now and gt these motors spinning. Polarity is important here. If you connect this backwards, there's a good chance your controller will get fried. And if that happens, there is a good chance you might cry. 

Your power should get hooked up like this.

OK. All set? 

1. Open UGS again
2. Refresh your ports
3. Select your port and click connect
4. Now you should hear a click and a whoooosh!
5. Click 'Machine Control' in UGS
6. Type G0 X10, click go. One of your motors should move! Hoooray for arduino.
7. Type G0 Y10, click go. Another One of your motors should move! Hooray for stepper motors!
8. Type G0 Z10, click go. The other motor that hasnt' moved yet should move! Hooray for you.
9. It's time to assemble the machine. Get your game face ready, it's go time!
10. If  your motors didn't turn, or there was as problem, please don't cry. Check this page [link to troubleshooting page] for some troubleshooting tips/tricks.
